## Damn u can have a readme as a bio, what's up? ğŸ‘‹

U r as shocked as I am? Create a repo and name it after ur username. Then, just initialize a readme and that's it. Yup, cool.

### Ok, now the real part of this readme

I just keep this unfinished like all my other side projects I never find the time to finish ğŸ¤ª
